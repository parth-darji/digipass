# DigiPass

DigiPass is the digitalization of the Indian paper bus system. The conductor has an app where he can scan a QR code from a student ID card which is in the form of a digital or plastic ID card.

It solves problems such as,

- Students don't have to stand in the Pass office line. So registration is easy and the student has two option want a physical pass or a digital pass (from their app).

- The conductor needs to just scan the QR code of students so they will know by ringing the sound whether the student is verified or not.

- This system manages the data efficiently by using Firebase as a backendless NoSQL database where I have implemented Authentication, Firestore, FCM, Storage, etc.

I used this application for the SSIP program in Gujarat which stands for Student Startup and Innovation Policy. Where I made this application with React Native and Firebase technology.
